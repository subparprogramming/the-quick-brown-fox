Yeah... not really sure what this project is yet.

But some technologies we're looking to use are:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [react-spring](https://react-spring.io/)
- [SuperTokens](https://supertokens.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)
